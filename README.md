## The project üöÄ
The project is organised within the scope of an IT project management course. It is made to confront us to an industry-like project management and experience as much as possible what is done in the labor market.

The project's goal is to make 24 students collaborating on the same product. We are split in 4 teams of 6 : data management, networking, main UI and in-game UI. I was member of the in-game UI team as a designer. In that way I had to collaborate with other teams' designers to create and organize the project structure through UML class, sequences, interfaces and use-cases diagrams.

The project was made in Java using JavaFx, SceneBuilder, websockets & a Rest API and git with multiple branchs.

Rules : 2 players place up to 5 towers on the grid. Then, with pieces, they must connect the more towers they can.


## What I learned üåü
- Collaborate with other teams 
- Make decision and be able to explain them as clear as possible
- Project management methods application : deadlines, versioning, audits, intra & inter teams meetings, rigor,  quality...
- Confrontation with recurrent project management issues : lack of communication, misunderstanding of the specifications, over/under-involvement, delay...
